# Mais Receitas

“Mais Receitas” is an app made by me and [Lais Bonin](https://github.com/LaisBonin) with Flutter as part of Snow Academy activities. Basically, the app is a recipe book in Portuguese. 

The recipes were provided by [Adrianos Ferreira](https://github.com/adrianosferreira/afrodite.json). 

Some of the technologies used are: 

* Authentication through an API developed by [Pedro Ganem](https://github.com/pedrocganem).
* Firebase to store user's favorite recipes.
* Sliver App Bar.
* [Hive](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/) to locally store user's credentials.
* [Bottom navy bar](https://pub.dev/packages/bottom_navy_bar) package.

To run this repo, besides cloning it, you're going to need:
* Flutter and Dart
* An IDE of your choice (e.g. Vs Code)
* You must run "flutter pub get" when you open the project for the first time.
